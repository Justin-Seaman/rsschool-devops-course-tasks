# Terraform for AWS deployments

Deploying CI/CD changes via Terraform configuration files to test Infastructure as Code workflows.

## Terraform files

+ *main.tf* - main class responsible for configuraiton of state file to AWS S3 bucket backend.
+ *variables.tf* - environment specific variables file for aws-region, terraform state, and github OIDC connection.
+ *oidc.tf* - establishes OIDC trust relationship between AWS and GitHub. Only allowed for owner and repo set in variables.
+ *iam-gh_actions_role.tf* - grants FullAccess to core AWS Services to the role used for GitHub Actions OIDC.
+ *s3.tf* - Handles creation of s3 bucket for shared tf state

## GitHub Actions Files

On push to main branch, GitHub Actions will run based on yml action file in .github/workflows/terraform-deployment.yml to perform the following tasks

1. Perform a terraform format check on the contents of the repo
    + If this action fails with exit code 3, confirm the formatting of your terraform files before commiting. Run the following on your local git prior to push:
    > terraform fmt
2. Run terraform init and plan to compare the config to the state file and describe changes to be made upon apply
3. Run terraform apply to make the changes to the AWS resources.

## AWS information

+ IAM sign-on URL: [https://d-9a6769cb84.awsapps.com/start]
+ MFA required
+ Region = us-east-2

# Task 1: AWS Account Configuration

![hero](/.visual_assets/task_1.png)

## Objective

In this task, you will:

- Install and configure the required software on your local computer
- Set up an AWS account with the necessary permissions and security configurations
- Deploy S3 buckets for Terraform states
- Create a Github Actions workflow to deploy infrastructure in AWS

Additional tasks:

- Create a federation with your AWS account for Github Actions
- Create an IAM role for Github Actions

## Steps

1. **Install AWS CLI and Terraform**

   - Follow the instructions to install [AWS CLI 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
   - Follow the instructions to install [Terraform 1.6+](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform).
   - **optional** Configuring Terraform version manager [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)

2. **Create IAM User and Configure MFA**

   - In your AWS account, navigate to IAM and create a new user with the following policies attached:
     - AmazonEC2FullAccess
     - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
     - AmazonS3FullAccess
     - IAMFullAccess
     - AmazonVPCFullAccess
     - AmazonSQSFullAccess
     - AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess
![user](/.visual_assets/user.png)
![group](/.visual_assets/group.png)
![permission-set](/.visual_assets/permission-set.png)
   - Configure MFA for both the new user and the root user.
![jsrs_mfa](/.visual_assets/jsrs_mfa.png)
![root_mfa](/.visual_assets/root_mfa.png)
   - Generate a new pair of Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the user.
âœ… 
3. **Configure AWS CLI**

   - Configure AWS CLI to use the new user's credentials.âœ… 
   - Verify the configuration by running the command: `aws ec2 describe-instance-types --instance-types t4g.nano`. âœ… 
   ![aws-conf](/.visual_assets/aws-conf.png)

4. **Create a Github repository for your Terraform code**

   - Using your personal account create a repository `rsschool-devops-course-tasks` âœ… 

5. **Create a bucket for Terraform states**

   - Locking terraform state via DynamoDB is not required in this task, but recommended by the best practices. vvvv [âœ… DynamoDB not used for this stage]
   - [Managing Terraform states Best Practices](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-s3-backend)
   - [Terraform backend S3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/s3)
![encrypted_versioned_bucket.png](/.visual_assets/encrypted_versioned_bucket.png)

6. **Create an IAM role for Github Actions(Additional task)ðŸ’«**

   - Create an IAM role `GithubActionsRole` with the same permissions as in step 2:
     - AmazonEC2FullAccess
     - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
     - AmazonS3FullAccess
     - IAMFullAccess
     - AmazonVPCFullAccess
     - AmazonSQSFullAccess
     - AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess
     ![GHActions_Role](/.visual_assets/GHActions_Role.png)
   - [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_role)

7. **Configure an Identity Provider and Trust policies for Github Actions(Additional task)ðŸ’«**

   - Update the `GithubActionsRole` IAM role with a Trust policy following the next guides
   ![oidc_trust](/.visual_assets/oidc_trust.png)
   - [IAM roles terms and concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#id_roles_terms-and-concepts)
   - [Github tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)
   - [AWS documentation on OIDC providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create_GitHub)
   - `GitHubOrg` is a Github `username` in this case


8. **Create a Github Actions workflow for deployment via Terraform**
   - The workflow should have 3 jobs that run on pull request and push to the default branch:
     - `terraform-check` with format checking using [terraform fmt](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt)
     - `terraform-plan` for planning deployments [terraform plan](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan)
     - `terraform-apply` for deploying [terraform apply](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply)
     ![gh-action-stages](/.visual_assets/gh-action-stages.png)
   - [terraform init](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init)
   - [Github actions reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
   - [Setup terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)
   - [Configure AWS Credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
![gh-action-stages.png](/.visual_assets/gh-action-stages.png)

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
