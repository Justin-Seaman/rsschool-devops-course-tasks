# Task 6: Application Deployment via Jenkins Pipeline

![task_6 schema](.visual_assets/task_4-6.png)

## Basic Infrastructure Configuration

For this task, I am re-using my Application Dockerfile and Helm chart from Task 4 Branch. `flask_app` is the core app directory from [source repo](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/devops/flask_app) and `hello-flask` is the helm chart for this app.

I also included the Jenkins configuration used to run this deployment in a .jenkins file. Longterm plan is to add the Pipeline intialization to the JCasC config along with the HelloWorld.

*I may attempt to add a helm chart to deploy the (Cloudlfard Helm Chart)[https://github.com/cloudflare/helm-charts] so I no longer need to depend on NodeIp and can handle Ingress with this proxy. To do this I would probably just capture the full helm chart for jenkins and add cloudflared to the /charts directory.*

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€â”€.jenkins
â”œâ”€â”€â”€flask_app   
â””â”€â”€â”€hello-flask
    â””â”€â”€â”€templates
```
### Creating a running Jenkins K8s service locally:
I am running on a minikube node for local dev.

1. Going to my [OAuth application for GitHub SSO](https://github.com/settings/applications/3070619) in my Jenkins app setting the `callback url` to the result of `minikube ip` (I later changed this to my public Cloudflare endpoint FQDN).
2. Taking Note of the Client-Id and re-creating a Client-Secret
3. Runnnig the following on my K8s Cluster to create the jenknins namespace and assign secret values to it:

```ps1
# Replace strings with values from step 2
$client_id = "Enter Client ID"
$client_secret = "Enter Client Secret"

kubectl create namespace jenkins

kubectl -- create secret generic github-oauth-secret `
  --from-literal=client-id=$client_id$ `
  --from-literal=client-secret=$client_secret `
  -n jenkins
```

4. Running the following commands to create a provisioned directory in the node to use for the PV

```ps1
minikube ssh
$ mkdir /data/jenkins-volume
$ sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /data/jenkins-volume
```

5. Create the PV and Storage Class with `kubectl apply -f jenkins-01-volume.yaml`
6. Create the standard service accounts with `kubectl apply -f jenkins-02-sa.yaml`
7. Install the Jenkins Helm Chart with configured values from Task_4.
```ps1
$chart=jenkinsci/jenkins
helm install jenkins -n jenkins -f jenkins-values.yaml $chart
```
You can now confirm that Jenkins is running on your cluster's node port by running `minikube ip` and navigating to the http://ip-address:320000

### Quickly Serving out the Service Using Cloudfared
Because I am running this from my home computer on non-business internet, I would need some type of Dynamice DNS or Proxy to serve my site publicly for use with GitHub Webhooks. Using webhooks will be critical for triggering the run on repo actions like Push. Webhooks will not send properly to my Private IP, because it is sent from GitHub's services, not my local computer.

To solve for this quickly, I used [CloudFlare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). Cloudflare was the best platform for my use case because I already handle Domain management for my domain `justinseaman.com` with Cloudflare. However, you can take other steps to serve publicly i.e. NAT, [Azure AppProxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-proxy/), [EKS LBs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/load-balancing.html) etc. 

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) tenant.
2. [Create a Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) for the Jenkins Applicaiton private IP
3. In the created [application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/), define a new [Access Policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to bypass all access to the site (not require a Cloudlfare Zero Trust User login).
![.visual_assets/app-policy.png](.visual_assets/app-policy.png)

This is essentially an open NAT and HTTPS proxy from http://<private-ip>:320000 to https://<application-url>:443. 

Confirm access by navigating to the Application's URL.
![.visual_assets/pub_jenkins.png](.visual_assets/pub_jenkins.png)
You can restrict the policies and define more granular WAF policies as needed (e.g. only bypass on /webhooks and /securityRealm/finishLogin while forcing ZeroTrust auth on other paths)

### Pipeline Initialization in Jenkins
The Objective of Jenkins Pipeline Configuration is to:
1. Use a Jenkinsfile stored in the git repository to handle Pipeline logic (much like GitHub Actions artifacts are directly associated with repo).
2. Establish Webhook communication from GitHub to Jenkins on key repo events.

When building the pipeline, I did the following:
1. Set the following fields on the Pipeline Configure page:
+ **Description:** 
```plaintext
This project will run the following Pipeline steps on every Push to the repo:
   1. Application build
   2. Unit test execution
   3. Security check with SonarQube
   4. Docker image building and pushing to any Registry
   5. Deployment to the K8s cluster with Helm (dependent on the previous step)
   6. (Optional) Application verification (e.g., curl the main page, send requests to API, smoke test)
```
+ **Triggers:** Enable `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`
+ **Pipeline:** Definition = "Pipeline script from SCM"
+ **SCM:** Git
+ **Repository URL**: URL to root of GitHub Repo
+ **Credentials**: Will be generated in following step
+ **Branch Specifier:** Restricted to task_6 with `*/task_6`
+ **Script Path:** Jenkinsfile

2. Create the Jenkins Credential Provider `GitHub App` Credentials by following the [guidance documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/github-app.adoc#creating-the-github-app) for the [GitHub Branch Source](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/) plugin. At it's core, this involves:
   1. Creating a GitHub App
   2. Setting the name, Homepage, and Webhook URLs (https://<jenkins-host>/github-webhook/)
   3. Set the appropriate GitHub permissions for the app
   4. Configure the `Subscribe to events` to list which triggers will launch the application
   5. Make note of the `App ID` and download the generated private key, and convert to a Jenkins readable format using this [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/) command `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in key-in-your-downloads-folder.pem -out converted-github-app.pem -nocrypt`
   6. Install the app to the repo using your account.
3. Confirm the Jenkins Server responds with 200 when a webhook is triggered on push in the "Advanced" settings of the GitHub App (you can `Redeliver` webhooks as well).
![.visual_assets/webhook-200.png](.visual_assets/webhook-200.png)
4. Create a basic Jenkinsfile in the repo with the following content for testing:
```Groovy
def branches = [:]

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  def index = i 
  branches["branch${index}"] = {
    node {
      retry(3) {
        checkout scm
      }
      echo "hello world ${index}"
    }
  }
}

retry(3) {
  parallel branches
}
```
5. Check your pipeline on Push for the output of the test Jenkinsfile (should see checkout and run of Jenkinsfile, along with Hello World #0-9).
![.visual_assets/test-pipeline.png](.visual_assets/test-pipeline.png)

### Turning the Jenkinsfile into a CI/CD pipeline

Requirements for the following steps in the pipeline:
1. Application build
   + I already handled a
2. Unit test execution
   + Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to assert a response of 200 at the root of the flask app. 
3. Security check with SonarQube
   + Static code analysis with Sonar will use the [Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonarqube-plugin) and a [Sonar Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) free account.
4. Docker image building and pushing to any Registry
   + Already handled in my GHA plan from task_5. Will refactor for Groovy/Jenkinsfile.
5. Deployment to the K8s cluster with Helm (dependent on the previous step)
   + Once Docker image built and published, a Helm build with the same tag should pull it down for CD
6. (Optional) Application verification (e.g., curl the main page, send requests to API, smoke test)
   + Quick smoke test to the private IP of the application.
